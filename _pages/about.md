About Me
===
Hello, I am Yinchi Zhou, currently an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University. I am from Beijing, China. I'm passionate about the interdisciplinary field of technology and healthcare. I wish to explore more topics including software, machine learning, and digital health. I worked on some projects in these fields, including the application of AI in clinical decision-making, machine learning algorithms in medical imaging analysis, and apps for Alzheimer's patients.  

At college, I am the TA of the course EECE2123 Digital System. I am also tutoring CS students in Java and C++. I serve as the international relationship co-chair at the Multicultural Leadership Council to help support minority groups on campus. I am also the Senior Advisor of the Women In STEM Club  

I am fluent in English and Chinese, and I also know some basic French. In my free time, I like to listen to music, including classical, pop, and R&B. I can play the piano and the flute. I also love skiing and playing tennis.
