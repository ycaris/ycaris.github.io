Hello, I am Yinchi Zhou, currently Ph.D student in Biomedical Engineering at Yale University. Previously, I obtained my bachelor degree in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University. I am from Beijing, China. I'm passionate about the interdisciplinary field of technology and healthcare. My research focuses on the application of machine learning algorithm to process medical images and medical texts. I am currently working with Dr. Chi Liu and Dr. Nicha Dvornek at Yale University. In my undergrad, I also worked in Dr. Bennett Landman's lab. 


I am fluent in English and Chinese, and I also know some basic French. In my free time, I love playing tennis and golf, as well as snowboarding. I am also a fun of music, and I play the piano and the flute. You can also find me at Kpop concerts!
