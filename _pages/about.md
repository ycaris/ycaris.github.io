Hello! I’m Yinchi Zhou, a Ph.D. student in Biomedical Engineering at Yale University, working with Dr. Chi Liu and Dr. Nicha Dvornek. My research focuses on developing machine learning algorithms for the analysis of medical images and clinical text, aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy and advance healthcare through AI-driven innovations.

Before joining Yale, I received my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Vanderbilt University, where I conducted research in Dr. Bennett Landman’s lab on medical image analysis.

I am originally from Beijing, China, and I am fluent in English and Chinese, with a basic understanding of French. Outside of research, I enjoy playing tennis and golf, as well as snowboarding during the winter season. Music is also a big part of my life—I play the piano and flute. You can also see me in Kpop concerts!
